Stability in social, technical, and financial systems, as well as the capacity of organizations to work across borders, requires consistency in public policy across jurisdictions. The diffusion of laws and regulations across political boundaries can reduce the tension that arises between innovation and consistency. Policy diffusion has been a topic of focus across the social sciences for several decades, but due to limitations of data and computational capacity, researchers have not taken a comprehensive and data-intensive look at the aggregate, cross-policy patterns of diffusion. This work combines visual analytics and text and network analyses to help understand how policies, as represented in digitized text, spread across states. As a result, our approach can quickly guide analysts to progressively gain insights into policy adoption data. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system via case studies with a real-world policy dataset and qualitative interviews with domain experts.
