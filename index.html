    <p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
      We are a research group at the
      <a href="https://xx">University of Pittsburgh</a>. Our
      mission is to understand human nature and society at scale.
    </p>
    <p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
      Society generates, and is shaped by, more data than ever before. This creates the opportunity to study human nature and society in new ways. Nearly every field of social science stands to be transformed by data. 
      <!-- Example research questions include:
      <ul>
        <li>How does information spread on social media?</li>
        <li>How can we create innovative teams of people?</li>
        <li>How is new technology shaping the economy?</li>
        <li>How do people organize around political issues?</li>

          Visualization leverages human perception to make (potentially large)

        <h3 class="f4 mt0">Economic Complexity</h3>
        <p class="measure lh-copy">
          From international trade to workers' career to team management, economic systems rely on structure.
          Mapping and studying these structures builds on traditional economics by identifying the path-dependence of out-of-equilibrium dynamics.
          For example, relating international exports reveals the growth of national economies, occupations' skill requirements determine cities' <a href="publications/2021_urbanResilience.html">economic resilience</a>, and employee interactions determine information spread across a company, innovation, and the workers who are most central to corporate structure.
          Research in this area is enabled by large-scale data and methodologies following a broad spectrum of inspiration, including from physics, ecology, and complex systems.

        <h3 class="f4 mt0">Ethical AI & ML</h3>
        <p class="measure lh-copy">
          Artificial Intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have been increasingly used in public and private domains, ranging from business, public health, social services, to criminal justice, to assist in human decision-making. The rapid development and deployment of AI technologies creates tremendous ethical challenges in our society: biases are introduced in a number of ways through algorithmic decision-making aids, which can lead to biased outcomes, especially for minority populations and women. 
          Addressing such ethical challenges requires multi-disciplinary efforts. Research in this area will synthesize and innovate theories from machine learning, model building, ethic and cultural studies, psychology and cognitive sciences and lay the foundation to successfully navigate and <a href="publications/2019_fairsight.html">evaluate responsible AI practices</a>.
